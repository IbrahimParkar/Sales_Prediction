# Sales Prediction

Welcome to the Sales Prediction project repository! This project was developed as a personal endeavor to explore machine learning techniques for forecasting sales accurately based on advertising investments.

## Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to create a robust machine-learning model capable of accurately forecasting sales, empowering businesses with actionable insights for decision-making, resource allocation, and revenue optimization. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, the sales prediction and optimization model aims to provide organizations with accurate sales forecasts and effective strategies for advertising optimization.

## Key Features

- **Dataset**: This repository includes the dataset used for training and testing the sales prediction model. The dataset comprises comprehensive data on advertising channels and corresponding sales figures.
- **Data Preprocessing**: The code provided implements detailed data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering, to prepare the data for model training.
- **Model Development**: The repository contains code for building the machine learning model. It utilizes algorithms such as Linear Regression, Extra Trees Regressor and other models to predict sales accurately based on the provided features.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluation metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are included to assess the performance of the sales prediction model.

Feel free to explore the repository and leverage the resources provided to enhance your understanding of sales prediction techniques. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.
